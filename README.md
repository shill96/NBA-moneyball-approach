# NBA-moneyball-approach
In today’s world, sports like football, baseball, and basketball have become deeply integrated into entertainment and analytics. Basketball, in particular, dominates the sports landscape in the United States, with the NBA serving as a global hub for elite competition. In the ever-evolving world of professional basketball, data analytics has become a game-changer, reshaping the way teams evaluate talent, make strategic decisions, and build rosters. Much like the “Moneyball” revolution in baseball, the NBA has shifted toward data-driven decision-making, where advanced metrics influence scouting, player development, and in-game strategies.
